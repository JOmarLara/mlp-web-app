### **README: MLP XOR Neural Network Web App**

---

## **Project Overview**

This project implements a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** to solve the **XOR problem**, a classic benchmark in neural network research. It demonstrates the ability of an MLP to learn non-linear patterns through the implementation of hidden layers. The project is built using **TensorFlow.js** and runs entirely in the browser, making it accessible, interactive, and efficient.

This project showcases my expertise in:
1. Neural network architecture and implementation.
2. Mathematical modeling and optimization.
3. Modern web technologies for machine learning applications.
4. End-to-end deployment of AI solutions.

## **Features**

- **Interactive Training**: Users can train the model in real time in their web browser.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Test the trained model by providing inputs to observe the XOR output.
- **Browser-Based Framework**: No installation required; the app runs natively in any modern browser.
- **Clean User Interface**: Designed with HTML and CSS for usability and aesthetics.

## **Technical Breakdown**

### **The XOR Problem**
The XOR (exclusive OR) function is defined as:

- Output is `1` if exactly one of the two inputs is `1`.
- Output is `0` if both inputs are the same.

| Input 1 | Input 2 | XOR Output |
|---------|---------|------------|
|    0    |    0    |     0      |
|    0    |    1    |     1      |
|    1    |    0    |     1      |
|    1    |    1    |     0      |

The XOR problem is non-linearly separable, meaning a single-layer perceptron cannot solve it. An MLP introduces hidden layers that map the inputs into a higher-dimensional space where linear separation is possible.

### **Model Architecture**
1. **Input Layer**: Two nodes for the two inputs.
2. **Hidden Layer**: Four nodes with a sigmoid activation function.
3. **Output Layer**: A single node with a sigmoid activation for binary classification.

**Forward Pass**:
- Compute weighted sums at each layer and apply activation functions.

**Backpropagation**:
- Compute errors at the output layer and propagate them backward.
- Update weights using gradient descent to minimize the loss.

### **Loss Function**
The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to evaluate the performance:
```
Loss = (1/n) * Î£ (y_pred - y_true)^2
```
Where:
- `y_pred` is the predicted output.
- `y_true` is the actual output.

### **Optimization**
Weights are updated using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):
```
Weight_new = Weight_old - (learning_rate * gradient)
```
